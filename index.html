        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm a Computer Science student at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). 
            My interest lies in software engieering, which I am actively pursuing opportunities in.
            Driven by a desire to help others, I get excited by experiences where I would be able to make a real positive impact.
            Below you can find some tools/technologies that I have worked with in the past, however my greatest skill is not these languages, 
            but rather my ability to use them to solve problems! You can check out some of the stuff I've worked on on my 
            <a href="https://github.com/HaseebGarfinkel">GitHub</a>. Feel free to shoot me a connection request on 
            <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/haseeb-garfinkel/">LinkedIn</a> as well or email me at haseebgarfinkel@gmail.com to chat!

        <h2>Experiences</h2>
        <p>Learn a little more about some of the experiences that I have had outside the classroom.</p>
        <h3>Elegant Mind Club UCLA</h3>
        <p>I am currently a research assistant at Professor Katsushi Arisaka's lab, aka the Elegant Mind Club. I am working on a team
        as part of project TERESA - Teleported Reality Surgical AI. My role involves development on a robotic arm built for precise surgical 
        applications. I am working on embedded code in C and C++ for the arm, as well as simulation software for a computer visualization of
        it using Python. The goal is to use this simulation to aid in training AI tools for controlling the robot.
        </p>
        <h3>HYEL</h3>
        <p>I previously led a small team on a game development project for a startup app called HYEL. HYEL is a mobile app featuring a 
        variety of games that users can have fun with and compete with their friends. My team's game was called Ocean Explorers,
        inspired by the classic game Crossy Road. This experience taught me a lot about software development as me and my team went
        through the full development lifecycle, including designing, coding, testing, and everything in between. 
        </p>
        <h3>De Anza Computer Lab</h3>
        <p>I also previously spent time as an intern at De Anza College's Computer Lab, in which I worked on getting used computers
        ready for student use in order to give disadvantaged students access to the technology they needed. My tasks included 
        wiping computers, configuring new operating systems, and troubleshooting to identify and resolve issues pertaining to 
        both software and hardware.
